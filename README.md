Due Date: 8/30/2019

Creating a basic UI is necessary to understanding how to organize shiny applications for users. Students are expected to design and create a basic layout using one of the generic datasets provided with base R or a common package (mtcars, diamonds, starwars, etc). 

The UI should have two (2) input elements and one (1) plot and/or data table. The input elements do not have to interact with the plots or data tables for this assignment, they simply must be present in the UI.
