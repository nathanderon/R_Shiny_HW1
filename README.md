# Homework 1

Due Date: 8/30/2019

Creating a basic UI is necessary to understanding how to organize shiny applications for users. Students are expected to choose one of the layouts discussed during the first week of class and create a basic layout using one of the generic datasets provided in some R packages (mtcars, diamonds, starwars, etc). 

The UI should have two (2) input elements and one (1) plot and/or data table. The input elements do not have to interact with the plots or data tables for this assignment, they simply must be present in the UI.
